        Dindigul Thalappakatti (previously Ananda Vilas Biriyani Hotel) was
        established in 1957 by <br /> Mr. Nagaswami Naidu in Dindigul, Tamil
        Nadu. The eatery quickly gained fame for its biryani, <br /> which was
        inspired by his wife Kannammaâ€™s handcrafted recipes known for their rich
        flavour <br /> and generous spices. Today, Dindigul Thalappakatti
        Biriyani stands tall and features 104 <br /> outlets across six
        countries, each one upholding the legacy of genuine taste and variety.
